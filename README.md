# FnlChad

Nvchad [starter](https://github.com/NvChad/starter/tree/main) repo 
completely ported to fennel.

To install, simply run 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/foldcat/FnlChad ~/.config/nvim && nvim
```
Run `:MasonInstallAll` command after lazy.nvim finishes 
downloading plugins.

It is recommended to remove the `.git` folder and the `README.md` 
file afterwards.

Check out `fnl/plugins/init.fnl` for plugins to make the lisp
editing experience better.
